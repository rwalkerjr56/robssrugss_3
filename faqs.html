                            <h3>What is a custom hand-tufted rug?</h3>
                            <p>A custom hand-tufted rug is a type of rug that is made by hand with the use of a tufting gun or needle which is used to push yarn through a tufting cloth. Unlike typical rugs where the yarn is knotted together, tufted rugs are crafted by intricately punching yarn through pre-existing patterns throughout the tufting cloth.</p>

                            <h3>How do you price your rugs?</h3>
                            <p>The price of a rug depends on multiple different factors, ranging from the size, the amount of colors used, the amount of necessary detail, and the amount of time it takes to execute it. With size being one of the main drivers of the price, the biggest rug I can make at the moment is 3.5 x 3.5 feet. </p>

                            <h3>How long does it take to make a rug?</h3>
                            <p>The time it takes to make a rug really depends on how big the rug is, how detailed it needs to be based on the desired design, and how many colors that are used. Another big factor is however long it takes to trim and detail the rug afterwards. The post-work alone could take a few days. The fastest rug I've made was finished in 2 days with a total of 6 hours all togher whereas the longest time I've taken to make a rug is arund 2-3 weeks.</p>
